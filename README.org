* About
CL-WEBVIEW is a common lisp binding to [[https://github.com/webview/webview][webview/webview]], a tiny tiny
cross-platform webview library to build modern cross-platform GUIs.

* Example
** Basic
#+name: cl-webview-example
#+begin_src lisp
  (in-package :cl-webview)

  ;; in SLY/SLIME like multiple-thread situation
  (with-webview (webview :title "Basic 1" :debug? t)
    (webview-set-html webview "<h1>CL-WEBVIEW | Example</h1>"))
#+end_src

This will open a webview window with =CL-WEBVIEW | Example= as =h1= header.

** CLOG
#+name: clog-webview-example
#+begin_src lisp
  ;; Just copy the CLOG tutorial 01-tutorial.lisp
  ;; https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog/blob/main/tutorial/01-tutorial.lisp

  (defpackage #:clog-webview-example
    (:use :cl :clog :cl-webview)
    (:export #:main))

  (in-package :clog-webview-example)

  (defun on-new-window (body)
    "On-new-window handler. "
    (setf (title (html-document body)) "CLOG and CL-WEBVIEW")
    (let ((hello-element (create-child body "<h1> Hello World! (click me!) </h1>")))
      (set-on-click hello-element
                    (lambda (obj)
                      (declare (ignore obj))
                      (setf (color hello-element) :green)))))

  (defun main ()
    "Start tutorial. "
    (initialize #'on-new-window)
    (with-webview (webview :debug t)
      (webview-navigate webview (format nil "http://127.0.0.1:~A" *clog-port*)))
    (uiop:quit))

  ;; And if you want, you can save the app like this:
  ;; 
  ;;   (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "clog-webview" :toplevel #'main :executable t :compression t)
  ;;
  ;; But here's a little tricky thing:
  ;; since libwebview is just linked to system's spec directory, 
  ;; so you cannot just copy the final executable file and send to
  ;; normal user. see Installation section for more.
#+end_src

* Installation
Clone, and load, that should be okay.

The requirement for libwebview could be seen in [[https://github.com/webview/webview][webview/webview]].
Behind the scene, in =preload.lisp=, I wrote a small script to
execute the webview's =build.sh= and link the header file =webview.h=
and the library =libwebview.dylib= under =spec= folder. The =spec= folder
will be added to =cffi:*foreign-library-directories*= for library search.

If you found your machine failed to compile or just don't need the
compile process, you could commit the =eval-when= code ([[file:preload.lisp::14][preload.lisp]]),
and compile yourself.

Also, if you want to pack the application and deliver it to normal
user. You may consider copy the dynamic lib with the executable,
and push the lib path to =cffi:*foreign-library-directories*=. 

* Others
** macOS patch
I was using SBCL on macOS, and as you may know, in macOS, a GUI app
should have UI thread as the main thread, so the app should run
in main thread by =run-in-main-thread=.

However, an error is that if an app crash and you choose to terminate
it, it would hang up the main loop and won't let next window to show.
Another error is that i don't know how to add multiple window support,
since the main loop was all taken by the first window. Helps are needed.

** Packaging
*** Packaging on macOS
Here is a simple script that I use for packing on macOS:

#+name: packaging-on-macos-shell
#+begin_src shell
  # inspired from:
  # https://github.com/jimon/osx_app_in_plain_c/blob/master/appify

  SOURCE=clog-webview-example.lisp
  TARGET=HELLO
  TOPLEVEL=clog-webview-example::main

  DIR=${TARGET}.app/Contents

  mkdir -p ${DIR}/{Resources/lib,MacOS}

  sbcl --load $SOURCE \
       --eval "(save-lisp-and-die \"${DIR}/MacOS/${TARGET}\" :toplevel '${TOPLEVEL} :executable t :compression t)"
#+end_src

it's bit simple, but it is just workable :p. I'll consider to add a
better mechanics to build and release the application. 

** Current Issure
+ +cannot open multiple window (=webview-run= hang up the main thread)+
+ cannot close the window by =webview-terminate= and =webview-destroy=.
